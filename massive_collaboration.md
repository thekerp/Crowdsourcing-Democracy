# Massive Collaboration
Massive collaboration exists all around us. Every day we live alongside a massive group of people that are mostly, although the media would certainly have us believe otherwise, civil and cooperative. By just living in a democratic society we are taking part in a massive collaboration. But this is what I would call a passive collaboration. We cooperate primarily by simply following the rules, by not actively doing anything to work against the peace. In this context the process in which we take part is one of maintenance. We work together to maintain a sort of cooperative homeostasis. But what about active participation in this same system? What form does this take? And what good does it do? Increasingly that is the question leaving a voting populace as disenfranchised as ever. Can one be actively involved? What percentage of the effort to be involved is actually helpful, actually effective? In our current system the answers to these questions always feel too tinged with optimism or faith in a certain system for the average cynic to bear. The answer is that we actively participate through our vote, which is ignored by our representatives with increasing frequency (see the previous section.) For those who want to do more, the answers to the question of how to be involved are frustrating. Donate money. Volunteer time. All things that simply feed into a broken system. Both of those answers are simply means to support a candidate, to pull votes one direction or another. Those answers boil down to "help us manipulate the voting system." This is not active participation in that sense that efforts result in output. Retreading to the notion of the decentralized system, this is a break. This is not part of the system, this is more the polishing of the housing in which the system runs. Then how can we be involved, hands on, with impact we can see, that we can track on an ongoing basis? The answer is that the system must change, it is time for the next evolution of the decentralized system of governance. Lucky for us, visionary programers, like Linus Torvalds already built all the tools that we need so that they could build things like the Linux operating system. We don't need to reinvent the wheel, we need only use it to maintain a different codebase: the US code.

Before diving into greater depth on these tools it is of value to look more closely at the passively collaborative system I mention above, to see the extent to which we are already steeped in cooperation and collaboration as we live in this democratic republic. We've begun with a look at the structure of the US Government, and its function in processing and producing code. As we work our way toward a discussion of possible future evolutions of this system it is important to step back a bit further to a broader question: What are laws? Why do we follow them? They guide our actions every day, but when was the last time you really stopped to think about what a law is? I don't mean, a bill becomes a law, so on and so on. I mean on a philosophical level, what is a law? Why do we have laws. The knee jerk answer is surely that we follow laws because otherwise we get in trouble. But, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that if you picked up a paper called "Crowdsourcing Democracy" or if you're reading this because you're interested in contributing to the project, that you follow lows because you believe that (mostly) they represent the right thing to do. If not that then at least you believe that laws represent the will of the people that these are the rules by which we agree to shape our behavior. Recently, in the course of a conversation about the state of democracy, and in response to what was probably a cynical comment on my part, a programmer friend said, "maybe you're right, but I also get a nice fuzzy feeling every time people pull over to let an ambulance pass. That's cooperation." At my core, like he, I'd also like to believe that everyone is pulling over for the ambulance because they know that it's a good thing to do, rather than because they otherwise might face legal consequences for failing to follow the law. Even aiming only for the middle ground, that most people are pulling over because they'd like you to do the same once they're the ambulance passenger, what we're talking about is cooperation, collaboration. So we can look at the laws as the guiding principles by which we know how not to get in trouble, or we can look at them as the tool that lets us know what everyone else is thinking with regards to appropriate behavior, or we can look at them as simply a reflection of how people would like themselves to be treated. Whether you are inclined toward the "carrot" or the "stick," it is undeniable that the purpose of most laws to to assure that everyone understands what is expected of them in order that our system of massive cooperation is maintained. For that is all that a democratic society is, in any form, meant to be: a system of massive cooperation. The US Code, that is, the collection of all laws by which be govern society is simply a program written, and modified over time through the system broken down in earlier chapter, to keep a huge number of people living in the same place, in cooperation.

Given the extent to which society is itself a cooperative and collaborative effort, let us now take a look at the extent to which the process of generating those rules is in fact collaborative. In earlier sections we dealt with 



Democratic society is in itself a massive cooperative effort, but that is not the "massive collaboration" from which this section gleans its title. The purpose of this section is to  

The with the law as code, and the judicial system as processor, we have congress as the programmers. The ones who write the code. In the United States representative democracy, these programmers are chosen by the people, and they are given the responsibility of writing the program that keeps cool
