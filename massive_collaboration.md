# Massive Collaboration
Massive collaboration exists all around us. Every day we live alongside a massive group of people that are mostly, although the media would certainly have us believe otherwise, civil and cooperative. By just living in a democratic society we are taking part in a massive collaboration. But this is what I would call a passive collaboration. We cooperate primarily by simply following the rules, by not actively doing anything to work against the peace. In this context the process in which we take part is one of maintenance. We work together to maintain a sort of cooperative homeostasis. But what about active participation in this same system? What form does this take? And what good does it do? Increasingly that is the question leaving a voting populace as disenfranchised as ever. Can one be actively involved? What percentage of the effort to be involved is actually helpful, actually effective? In our current system the answers to these questions always feel too tinged with optimism or faith in a certain system for the average cynic to bear. The answer is that we actively participate through our vote, which is ignored by our representatives with increasing frequency (see the previous section.) For those who want to do more, the answers to the question of how to be involved are frustrating. Donate money. Volunteer time. All things that simply feed into a broken system. Both of those answers are simply means to support a candidate, to pull votes one direction or another. Those answers boil down to "help us manipulate the voting system." This is not active participation in that sense that efforts result in output. Retreading to the notion of the decentralized system, this is a break. This is not part of the system, this is more the polishing of the housing in which the system runs. Then how can we be involved, hands on, with impact we can see, that we can track on an ongoing basis? The answer is that the system must change, it is time for the next evolution of the decentralized system of governance. Lucky for us, visionary programers, like Linus Torvalds already built all the tools that we need so that they could build things like the Linux operating system. We don't need to reinvent the wheel, we need only use it to maintain a different codebase: the US code.

Before diving into greater depth on these tools it is of value to look more closely at the passively collaborative system I mention above, to see the extent to which we are already steeped in cooperation and collaboration as we live in this democratic republic. We've begun with a look at the structure of the US Government, and its function in processing and producing code. As we work our way toward a discussion of possible future evolutions of this system it is important to step back a bit further to a broader question: What are laws? Why do we follow them? They guide our actions every day, but when was the last time you really stopped to think about what a law is? I don't mean, a bill becomes a law, so on and so on. I mean on a philosophical level, what is a law? Why do we have laws. The knee jerk answer is surely that we follow laws because otherwise we get in trouble. But, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that if you picked up a paper called "Crowdsourcing Democracy" or if you're reading this because you're interested in contributing to the project, that you follow lows because you believe that (mostly) they represent the right thing to do. If not that then at least you believe that laws represent the will of the people that these are the rules by which we agree to shape our behavior. Recently, in the course of a conversation about the state of democracy, and in response to what was probably a cynical comment on my part, a programmer friend said, "maybe you're right, but I also get a nice fuzzy feeling every time people pull over to let an ambulance pass. That's cooperation." At my core, like he, I'd also like to believe that everyone is pulling over for the ambulance because they know that it's a good thing to do, rather than because they otherwise might face legal consequences for failing to follow the law. Even aiming only for the middle ground, that most people are pulling over because they'd like you to do the same once they're the ambulance passenger, what we're talking about is cooperation, collaboration. So we can look at the laws as the guiding principles by which we know how not to get in trouble, or we can look at them as the tool that lets us know what everyone else is thinking with regards to appropriate behavior, or we can look at them as simply a reflection of how people would like themselves to be treated. Whether you are inclined toward the "carrot" or the "stick," it is undeniable that the purpose of most laws to to assure that everyone understands what is expected of them in order that our system of massive cooperation is maintained. For that is all that a democratic society is, in any form, meant to be: a system of massive cooperation. The US Code, that is, the collection of all laws by which be govern society is simply a program written, and modified over time through the system broken down in earlier chapter, to keep a huge number of people living in the same place, in cooperation.

It would seem, following from this way of looking at laws that the people demand a certain degree of input as to what these rules are. As it turns out, beyond casting a vote, the public has very little say in what actually ends up in a law. Given the extent to which society is itself a cooperative and collaborative effort, let us now take a look at the extent to which the current process of generating the rules is in fact collaborative. In the earlier section we looked quickly at the lawmaking process from the standpoint of decentralization, but what about lawmaking from the standpoint of collaboration? The people vote for representatives, and those representatives are tasked with writing, presenting, and defending the laws that they think are in the interest of the population they represent. In addition these representatives vote on every other law presented. While this does qualify as relatively decentralized, it seems a stretch to call this collaborative. Certainly it is not solitary, and it is collaborative in the sense that the population is working together to pick a representative, and then that representative's team is working together to write a bill. Additionally the representatives are working together to modify those bills to get something together that they can get voted through. Never mind that step, where congress "cooperates," what we're here to look at is the actual making of the law. To what extent is the making of the document that our representative takes to congress to try to pass, ostensibly because his or her constituents sent them, the result of actual collaboration? The answer is, it's not. Maybe they took some input in a town meeting, maybe they even took comments on the web, but ultimately most bills are written by five to ten staffers in a representative's office, and they are written to the specifications called for by the representative, or even the representative's political party. Until they hit the floor for debate in Congress the people don't get to see the bill, and even once they are available for debate there is little short of contacting your representative that can be done to proactively remedy a fault in that bill. This is not a collaborative process, and this is the break point for the decentralization. At this node, lawmaking is centralized. The only ones putting ideas on paper are those in the representatives office. 

The number of people enlisted to write a bill is as such out of necessity, just as less centralized systems functioned as they did out of the necessity of the time. But, as discussed previously, the evolution of communication technology and the ability to decentralize a system march hand in hand. Previously the notion of taking input on a bill from a massive number of people was simply not workable. There would be too much paper, too much reading, too much editing, too much work to keep the bill coherent. This is no longer a problem. We built the tools to solve these problems so we could manage massive teams, working on massive libraries of code. So finally, lets take a look at these tools.

The first thing to understand about program is that it's simply writing. They call it "writing code." The language you are speaking in the language of computational problem solving, and the grammar depends on the programming language. But everything a computer does, every picture, over tool, every status update can be distilled to written code. That code could be printed out, if one were so inclined. If the code of Linux, a popular open source operating system, were printed on paper it would be in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand pages of text. Naturally a document this long is not written by a single person, it takes many many people. Traditionally this many people working on a single document would be a mess, and for a very long time working on programs as a team was just that, messy.

A law is not unlike the codebase for an operating system. Unlike something like, say, this paper, there is a remarkable degree of interconnectivity. If you started where I recommended earlier, with the TED by Clay Shirky, you'll have already seen graphical representations of this interconnectivity.
