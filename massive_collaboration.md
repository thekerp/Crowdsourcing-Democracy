# Massive Collaboration
What are laws? Why do we follow them? The knee jerk answer is surely that we follow laws because otherwise we get in trouble. But, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that if you picked up a piece called "Crowdsourcing Democracy" or if you're reading this because you're interested in contributing to the project, that you follow lows because you believe that (mostly) the represent the right thing to do, or at least the will of the people that others follow them too. Recently, in the course of a conversation about the state of democracy, and in response to what was probably a cynical comment on my part a programmer friend said, "maybe you're right, but I also get a nice fuzzy feeling every time people pull over to let an ambulance pass. That's cooperation." Like him, at the core, I'd also like to believe that everyone is pulling over for the ambulance because they know that it's a good thing to do, rather than because they otherwise might face legal consequences for failing to follow the law. Even aiming only for the middle way, that most people are pulling over because they'd like you to do the same once they're the ambulance passenger, what we're talking about is cooperation, collaboration. So we can look at the laws as the guiding principles by which we know how not to get in trouble, or we can look at them as the tool that lets us know what everyone else is thinking. Whether you are inclined toward the "carrot" or the "stick," it is undeniable that the purpose of most laws to to assure that everyone understands what is expected of them in order that our system of massive cooperation is maintained. For that is all that a democratic society is, in any form, meant to be: a system of massive cooperation. To take the view that laws are code: a program for massive cooperation.






And in that sense they guide our actions every day, but when was the last time you really stopped to think about what a law is? I don't mean, a bill becomes a law, so on and so on. I mean on a philosophical level, what is a law? Why do we have laws. In the end the answer is cooperation, and collaboration. So in that way,


The with the law as code, and the judicial system as processor, we have congress as the programmers. The ones who write the code. In the United States representative democracy, these programmers are chosen by the people, and they are given the responsibility of writing the program that keeps cool
