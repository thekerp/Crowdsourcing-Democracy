###Hello!

On GitHub? Someone else fill you in? The info you need is below.

On Gitbook? Cool. Keep reading.

Welcome to the repository for my exploration of government and the law in the age of Uber, when software is quickly taking over the world.

I'm Adam. I set this up. I'm working on it, right now. Other people might be too, any time you check in it might be different. First draft is due in a month. At this point, if you're here you're a friend, classmate, family member or professor. Thank you for taking a look!

What you see in front of you is already an example of the tools I'll be writing about and their implications for society, and systems of government.

This project will take shape using the same tools that programmers use to coordinate and collaborate while working on software that is text based and both hieracrchical and non-linear at the same time (just like legal documents). As of now GitBooks is mostly a layer for sharing and public comments. 

If you're here on a computer you can comment by clicking on the little "+" icon to the right of any section. (Right now it's a number because I have some comments. Try clicking the number. ->

If you want to make changes, that's happening via GitHub, which will actually be in the paper later under in the "Massive Collaboration" chapter. If you want to dig in that info is below. Eventually I'll get a tutorial of some sort up to help transition people who want to contribute.

I'm working continually, so what you see here is what I've got so far. Interested, dig in, reach out, I'll help you get rolling as a contributor. You should be able to comment with thoughts or questions by clicking the little plus that comes up when you mouse over any given section.

If you've got a few minutes the video below is the thing that got me going down this road to begin with. I retread some of Shirky's stuff in the paper so far, but I'm trying to end with at least the start for an actual proposed system by which to deploy this into lawmaking, and a discussion of its merits. I'll keep putting other cool links down here as I bump into them.

DO YOU ALREADY USE GITHUB? READ BELOW:

This is synced with [yon Github Repo.](https://github.com/thekerp/Crowdsourcing-Democracy)

Anything merged with the master ends up here on GitBook where I send people to read and comment as someone likely first did to you. Set up a GitBook account to interact with public comments. You can also tie that to your GitHub account quite nicely.

GitBook pulls its structure for the Table of Contents from the SUMMARY.md

This document right here is README.md

Chapter is a new .md file, titled and pointed to in SUMMARY.md

**Try not to eff that structure up.** Minimizing maintenance is an important part of making sure I can pull off the portion of the piece where it gets all meta and I talk about how many collaborators we have on this project.

I think that's it.

Fork on brave souls.
